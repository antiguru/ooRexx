# Phase 6.1 gate record

Performance base: `e6af1198b` (the commit Task 1 starts from). Budget (spec section 5): a running
total of at most +0.5% beyond the noise band on every program; wall clock within ±4%.

## Task 1

Commits: `66b0f6854` (layout), `16b67c6cc` (behaviour), `12239c974` (perf round 1). `S` is
`/tmp/claude-1000/p61/t1`; each binary from `git archive <sha> rust interpreter`, built with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$S/target-NAME memcap 8G cargo build --release -j 4 -p rexx-exec --bin rexx-run`,
one `Compiling rexx-exec` line each.

Noise band, the layout controls against base:

```
bash rust/bench-programs/callgrind.sh -r 3 -j 8 -o $S/cg-pad -p "fibcall fibfunc dispatch dispatchclass sendloop" base=$S/bin/base/rexx-run pad1=$S/bin/pad1/rexx-run pad2=$S/bin/pad2/rexx-run pad3=$S/bin/pad3/rexx-run
```

Exit 0. Every control delta on every program prints as `0.0000`% (largest absolute difference 136
instructions, `sendloop` pad3), so the band is 0 and the budget is +0.5%.

Instructions:

```

```

Exit 0, every spread 0.0000%.

| program | t1 % | r1 % | verdict |

| dispatchclass | +0.8357 | +0.1013 | inside |
| sendloop | +1.1774 | +0.1427 | inside |

t1 was over on every program: `pop_activation`, inlined into its callers at base, went out of line
(`cgdiff.py` on `sendloop`: `finish_send` -245,000,269, `pop_activation` +365,005,475). Round 1
moved the termination restore to a cold helper, forced `pop_activation` inline and kept
`TraceCache` at its base shape.

Wall clock:

```

Exit 0; load average 2.59 at start, 1.47 at end.

Every program inside ±4%.

## Task 2

Commits: `5b7acef35` (behaviour), `9777db504` (perf round 1), `fe765db7b` (witness), `4d46b76b0` (whole-group lines). `S` is
`/tmp/claude-1000/p61/t2`; base and pads are Task 1's binaries (sha256 above, re-checked). Each
Task 2 binary from `git archive <sha> rust interpreter`, built with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$S/target-NAME memcap 8G cargo build --release -j 4 -p rexx-exec --bin rexx-run`,
one `Compiling rexx-exec` line each.

```

(`B` is `/tmp/claude-1000/p61/t1/bin`.) Exit 0. The layout controls print `+0.0000`% on every
program, so the band is 0 and the budget is +0.5%.

| program | t2 % | r1 % | verdict |

| emptyloop | +18.6211 | -0.3229 | inside |
| decloop | +3.1105 | +0.4373 | inside |
| rexxcps | +0.4163 | +0.2741 | inside |

t2 was over: the fast flat header's closure stopped being inlined into `ops_loop_steady`
(`cgdiff.py` on `emptyloop`: `flat_loop_header::{closure#0}` +875,001,750 as a symbol of its own,
`ops_loop_steady` +624,854,607). Round 1 spells the clause out (`enter_clause`, the advance,
`leave_clause`), keeps WHILE/UNTIL/COUNTER as bits of one `PassTest` byte, and moves the driver's
`LoopHeaderValue` work into one filing call.

Wall clock:

```
PROGRAMS="emptyloop decloop rexxcps" bash rust/bench-programs/wallclock.sh -r 5 -o $S/wall base=$B/base/rexx-run pad2=$B/pad2/rexx-run r1=$S/bin/r1/rexx-run
```

Exit 0; load average 0.16 at start, 0.57 at end.

| program | pad2 % | r1 % |
|---|---:|---:|
| emptyloop | -0.23 | +4.16 |
| decloop | +0.84 | -0.84 |
| rexxcps | -2.03 | +0.81 |

**`emptyloop` is outside ±4% on wall clock.** Two more emptyloop-only runs of the same command
gave +4.18 and +4.42. `perf stat -e cycles`, three runs each: base 1.262-1.288 G, Task 1's `r1c`
1.281-1.291 G, Task 2's r1 1.316-1.348 G; branch misses equal (370,386 against 384,551). The cost is
cycles at fewer instructions, and `perf annotate` puts it in `loop_advance` (20.3% of cycles at base,
37.4% at r1, where `cgdiff.py` gives it 49,999,953 fewer instructions). Two further rounds moved it the wrong way:
`DO WITH`'s state out of `LoopState` (+6.5% cycles) and the counter boxed in `FlatLoop` (+10%).
Neither landed. Three rounds are spent; this stops for Moritz's ruling.

Ruling (Moritz, 2026-10-07): the `emptyloop` wall-clock overrun is accepted for now and is
re-checked at Task 12 with a layout control.

Whole-group rows that `4d46b76b0` rewrote. Each failure was visible only once DO COUNTER stopped
refusing, and none of them is caused by the loops. Each test was run alone on both engines from an
ooTest copy with every other `test_*` method renamed. The oracle passes every one; the column says
what ours fails on.

| group | test | ours, alone | cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| TRACE_TraceObject | TEST_VARIABLE | rc 1: `assertSame` 6 against 0, "number of variable related trace objects" (line 162) | no collected TraceObject has a VARIABLE entry |
| TRACE_TraceObject | TEST_CALLER_STACK_FRAME_REPLY_START | rc 1: `assertEquals` at line 706, a count of 0 where 2 is expected | no CALLERSTACKFRAME carries a THREAD entry |
| TRACE_TraceObject | TEST_TRACEOBJECT_COLLECTOR | rc 2: 97.1 at line 276, `.nil` does not understand STARTSWITH | the collector gathers fewer trace lines than the test produces |
| TRACE | TEST_TRACE_LABEL_WITH_FORWARD | rc 1: `test_forwarded3.rex` traces 10 lines against 12 (line 1188) | FORWARD/REPLY `>I>`/`<I<` lines across the replied activity |
| Method | TEST_NEWFILE_CONTEXT_FLOATINGMETHOD, TEST_NEWFILE_CONTEXT_IMPORTEDPACKAGE, TEST_NEW_CONTEXT_OMITTED, TEST_NEW_ARRAY_FROM_FILE, TEST_NEW_FILE_COMPILED | rc 2: three `assertEquals`/`assertOneOrAnother` failures and two 98.971 | Method NEW's file, array and context shapes; the whole run refuses at Method NEW (Phase 9) |

## Task 3

No performance measurement is owed at this task's close (global constraints). Per-task check at
`652826b54`, `S` = `/tmp/claude-1000/p61/t3/gate`: `memcap 8G cargo test -j 4 --workspace
--no-fail-fast` exit 0; `REXX_CORPUS_GATE=1 memcap 8G cargo test -j 4 -p rexx-exec --test corpus
--test ir_recorded_oracle` exit 0; `whole_groups` exit 101 on the rows below, which the
whole-group commit rewrites.

Whole-group and group-table rows the whole-group commit rewrites in `tests/concurrency_tests.rs`.
None is a regression: each is a refusal this task removed, or what running past it reaches.

| group | part | was | now | cause |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RexxContext | whole | refuses at TESTCONDITION01, CONDITION("O") | refuses at TESTCOPY01, `RexxContext~copy` (Phase 9) | `.context~condition` answers (c3), so the run reaches the next refusal |
| RexxContext | rest | assertions 354, failing [TESTRS01] | assertions 357, failing [TESTRS01] | TESTCONDITION01's three `assertEquals` now run and pass |
| TRACE | rest | assertions 117, failing set unchanged | assertions 118 | TEST_TRACE_OPTIONS, the group's one test of a form this task changed (OPTIONS, b1): started and not failing in the dumped run, so its `assertTraceOutput` is the attributed assertion |
| GUARD | derived | refuses at TEST_WHEN_USE_LOCAL_NO_WAIT, USE LOCAL | agrees with the oracle | USE LOCAL runs (b2); the two `DIFFERING` rows are deleted |
| GUARD | outcome table | `GUARD_PASSING` without TEST_WHEN_USE_LOCAL_NO_WAIT | with it | the same; `the_outcome_table_of_the_guard_group_in_both_modes` |
